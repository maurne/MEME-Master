# MEME-Master

Game: Meme Masters

Objective: Capture the opponent's "Meme King" or "Meme Queen" while protecting your own.

Game Board: A 10x10 grid, similar to a chessboard, but with a unique twist - each square on the board features a popular meme or internet trend. These squares provide bonuses or penalties based on the type of meme and the piece that lands on them.

Pieces: Both players have 20 pieces, each representing internet culture elements that Gen Z enjoys. Some examples:

Influencers (Pawns): Move one square forward, with the option to move two squares on their first move. They can capture diagonally, just like pawns in chess.

Gamers (Knights): Move in an L-shape, like knights in chess. Landing on a gaming-related meme square grants them an additional move.

Streamers (Bishops): Move diagonally, like bishops in chess. Landing on a streaming-related meme square allows them to teleport to any other streaming meme square on the board.

YouTubers (Rooks): Move horizontally or vertically, like rooks in chess. Landing on a YouTube-related meme square grants them invincibility for one turn.

Emoji Wizards (Queens): The most powerful piece, moving horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Landing on an emoji-related meme square doubles their movement range for the next turn.

Meme King/Queen (King): Moves one square in any direction. Capture your opponent's Meme King/Queen to win the game. If the Meme King/Queen is threatened with capture, it's called "Meme Check," and if there's no legal move to escape, it's "Meme Checkmate."

Gameplay:
Players take turns moving their pieces, aiming to capture the opponent's Meme King/Queen while defending their own. The meme squares' effects add an extra layer of strategy, making the game more dynamic and engaging for Gen Z players. To make it more accessible, incorporate a tutorial mode and tooltips explaining each piece's movements and abilities.

Integration:
To create a web-based game, use HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS for the frontend, and a server-side technology like Node.js for the backend. This combination allows for a responsive and interactive game experience that can run on various devices and platforms.
